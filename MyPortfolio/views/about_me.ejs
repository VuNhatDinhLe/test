    <p class="text">I am from Vietnam and currently studying at Centennial College. I had a diploma in information technology with a focus on networking and computer hardware. After graduating, I started working as a computer network and data system manager for a hospital in Vietnam. I'm hoping to be able to work as a professional programmer, implementing tasks associated with the topic I'm studying, after I graduate from Centennial College.</p> </div>
